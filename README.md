# Overview

This is a simple weather app that runs on the web usinng javascript API requests.

I wrote this to get more practice with javascript and learn how to use API for web apps.

# Development Environment

I used intelliJ by jetBrains as my IDE.

I used HTML to build the website, CSS to style it and javascript to attempt to make it dynamic. I also used a weather API from openweathermap.com.

# Useful Websites

- [W3Schools - Java, HTML, CSS](w3schools.com)
- [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org)

# Future Work

- I want to finish this - it still doesn't put data on the screen and I'm not sure it's actually getting any information from the API request
- Spruce it up visually
- Add options for different weather timeframes and data
- Make it into a mobile app, just for practice
